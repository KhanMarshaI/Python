Memory tiles game. The program will highlight three random tiles at the start the user has to find those tiles, if the user picks a wrong tile the score will go down. Once the user has detected all three tiles the program will generate three more random tiles.
Used PySimpleGUI as the GUI module. Used random module to generate random tiles. Used time module to display the tiles for a second.
